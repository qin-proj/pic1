# Unveiling cell-type-specific mode of evolution in comparative single-cell expression data
General Overview

We propose an analytical framework, grounded in phenotypic evolution theory, for the comparative analysis of single-cell expression data. Given a single-cell expression dataset comprising two species or populations, our framework decomposes the total expression variance into the divergence and noise for each gene in each cell type. Comparing across cell types and genes, we introduce two distinct approaches to identify genes exhibiting large evolutionary divergence and small expression noise in certain cell types. The first approach, termed the Negative Correlation (NC) strategy, leverages the negative correlation between inter-taxon divergence($D_{sp}^{n}$) and noise in one specific taxon ($V_{taxon}^{n}$). The second approach, termed DVR strategy, is based on the ratio of D<sub>sp</sub> to V<sub>taxon</sub>.
We apply these methodologies to two single-cell expression datasets: the primate prefrontal cortex (PFC) and naked mole-rat bone marrow.
